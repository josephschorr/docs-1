# Installing SpiceDB

SpiceDB is built as a standalone executable file which simplifies installation.

However, one should prefer one of the recommended installation methods detailed below.

<Callout type="info">
  Looking to deploy SpiceDB to a staging or production environment?

  [Authzed Serverless] is the fastest and most production-ready way to deploy SpiceDB.

  Self-hosted installations should deploy the [SpiceDB Operator].

  There are also [community-maintained examples] for demo environments.

## Recommended methods

### Docker

Container images are available for AMD64 and ARM64 architectures on the following registries:

- [authzed/spicedb](https://hub.docker.com/r/authzed/spicedb)
- [ghcr.io/authzed/spicedb](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/pkgs/container/spicedb)
- [quay.io/authzed/spicedb](https://quay.io/authzed/spicedb)

You can pull down the latest stable release:

```sh
docker pull authzed/spicedb
```

Afterwards, you can run it with `docker run`:

```sh
docker run \
    --name spicedb \
    -p 50051:50051 \
    authzed/spicedb \
    serve \
    --grpc-preshared-key "somerandomkeyhere"
```

The entrypoint of the container image is set to the SpiceDB binary to allow for easily running different commands and providing flags:

```sh
docker run \
    --name spicedb-testing \
    -p 50051:50051 \
    authzed/spicedb \
    serve-testing
```

### Debian packages
