# Installing Zed

Zed is built as a standalone executable file which simplifies installation.

However, one should prefer one of the recommended installation methods detailed below.

## Recommended methods

### Debian packages

[Debian-based Linux] users can install SpiceDB packages by adding an additional apt source.

First ensure the following dependencies are installed:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl ca-certificates gpg
```

Next, we can add, trust, and update the official SpiceDB apt source:

```sh
curl https://pkg.authzed.com/apt/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://pkg.authzed.com/apt/ * *" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/authzed.list'
sudo apt update
```

Install as usual:

```sh
sudo apt install -y zed
```

### RPM packages

[RPM-based Linux] users can install packages by adding a new yum repository:

```sh
sudo cat << EOF >> /etc/yum.repos.d/Authzed-Fury.repo
[authzed-fury]
name=AuthZed Fury Repository
baseurl=https://pkg.authzed.com/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF
```

Install as usual:

```sh
sudo dnf install -y zed
```
