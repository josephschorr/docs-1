### Community Support

Community support is available to absolutely everyone and does not require any form of payment or usage of Authzed products.

[Discord] is the first line of support for asking questions or getting help with SpiceDB.

For bug reports, feature requests, or questions [GitHub issues] is also available.

While AuthZed's products are proprietary, lots of the software used to deliver these products are open source.
Many folks participating in these open source communities are AuthZed customers or employees that have relevant experience.
