# Workload Isolation

Workload Isolation is functionality exclusive to AuthZed products that guarantees exclusive access to hardware to guarantee performance.

## Control Plane

Services that are secondary to serving real-time requests run one shared workload called the control plane.

These services include:

- AuthZed management UI and its accompanying machinery
- Observability services for the SRE team (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
- Compliance infrastructure
