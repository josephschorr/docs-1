# Extenders

Enterprise builds of SpiceDB support additional behavior provided by an extension point called `Extender`.

Extenders include:
- [Audit Logging](audit-logging)
- [Restricted API Access (FGAM)](restricted-api-access)

<Callout type="info">
  Both [Cloud] and [Dedicated] provide dashboards for configuring functionality powered by Extenders, but you might be interested to learn more if you're exploring Self-Hosted.

  [Dedicated]: ../guides/picking-a-product#dedicated

## Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
| -- | -- | -- |
--extender-audit-batch-size-limit | defines the maximum number of audit events to be processed as a unit | `10000` |
--extender-audit-buffer-size | defines the size of the audit log buffer that holds events to be processed by workers | `1000000` |
--extender-audit-buffer-window | defines maximum amount of time events are buffered before being pushed | `1s` |
--extender-audit-disabled-on-methods strings                      | list of comma-separated, fully-qualified API methods to disable events for. Watch API is always excluded (e.g. `/authzed.api.v1.PermissionsService/CheckPermission`) | |
--extender-audit-initial-retry-interval duration                  | sets the first retry backoff in case of a failure to push audit events to the backend | `1s` |
--extender-audit-max-retry-interval duration                      | sets the maximum backoff duration in case of failure to push events | `30s` |
--extender-audit-retry-randomizer-factor | sets the randomization factor for the backoff duration - this helps prevent thundering herds on event push errors | `0.5` |
--extender-audit-stream-name | defines the name of the target stream/topic (e.g. Kafka Topic, Kinesis Stream...) | `spicedb` |
--extender-audit-target-configuration | target-type specific configuration | `[]` |
--extender-audit-target-endpoint-url string                       | defines the URL of target endpoint to ingest audit events. If left unspecified, some types will try to determine automatically (e.g. AWS SDK) |
--extender-audit-target-type | defines the type of target to ingest audit events | `noop` |
--extender-audit-worker-count | defines the number of worker goroutines to process audit events (default 5) |
--extender-authzed-fgam-endpoint | defines the external SpiceDB endpoint used to authorize operations for the authzed-fgam extender. If a file:// endpoint is provided, server is run embedded with static configuration |
--extender-authzed-fgam-preshared-key | defines the external SpiceDB preshared key used to authorize operations for the authzed-fgam extender. Ignored if endpoint is local (file://) |
--extender-enabled | enables one or more extenders out of [authzed-fgam spicedb-enterprise-serverversion authzed-audit usage]. |
