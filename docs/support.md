# Support & Questions

## Community

Community support is available to absolutely everyone and does not require any form of payment or usage of Authzed products.

[Discord] is the first line of support for asking questions or getting help with SpiceDB.

For bug reports, feature requests, or questions [GitHub issues] is also available.

The community encompasses both Authzed employees, SpiceDB maintainers, and end-users volunteering their time to answer your questions.
Please be respectful and read over the community [Code of Conduct] before interacting.

## Gold Support

Gold Support is a paid plan that offers an additional escalation for tickets with an initial-response within 1 hour, 24/7.

For critical, outage-defining issues, those paying for Gold Support can email a private address provided during their onboarding.
This email bypasses the support queue and directly pages an on-call engineer.

## Silver Support

Silver Support is a paid plan that offers priority in the support queue with an initial-response within 24 hours during business hours.

If your email domain matches a Silver Support subscription, you can do any of the following:

- Email [support@authzed.com]
- Create a ticket on [support.authzed.com]

As long as you have an email domain of an organization with an active subscription.
