# Overview

SpiceDB Enterprise is the production-ready version of SpiceDB we use in our managed services.
You can license SpiceDB Enterprise to deploy into your own environment.

SpiceDB Enterprise comes with:

* [Fine-Grained Access Management tokens for your service accounts](/spicedb-enterprise/fgam)
* Full SpiceDB request audit logging
* Early access to security patches
* Additional enterprise-only functionality as it's released

For self-hosted deployments using SpiceDB Open Source or SpiceDB Enterprise we recommend purchasing a [support package](https://authzed.com/products/spicedb-sla-support).

## Accessing SpiceDB Enterprise

SpiceDB Enterprise is made available via the [authzed-enterprise] GitHub organization as a container image stored in the [organization's registry].

[authzed-enterprise]: https://github.com/authzed-enterprise
[organization's registry]: https://github.com/orgs/authzed-enterprise/packages

Images are signed using [cosign], storing a signature of their digests alongside the image in the registry.
They are also published publicly to the [rekor transparency log] operated by the [Linux Foundation's] security-focused foundation, the [OpenSSF].
You can read more about keyless container signing and verification in the [cosign documentation].
